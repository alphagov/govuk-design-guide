description: Topical event are used to communicate government activity about high-profile events or in response to a major crisis.
howItWorks:
 "Topical events pages used to communicate government activity about high-profile events or in response to a major crisis. Can be used for an event or crisis that is:

  - of high profile

  - that is current or relevant only for a short time (for example Ebola virus: UK government response)

  - of significance to the majority of GOV.UKâ€™s users (ie the event is receiving extensive coverage by major news media such as the Today programme)

  - the responsibility of central government

  - linked to more than one government department or agency

  - likely to generate a high volume of content (not just one or two news stories)
  

  Also worth noting that there may be a corresponding topical event's about page, which is made using the [topical event about frontend template](../about/topical-events)."
