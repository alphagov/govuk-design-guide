howItWorks:
  "We use smart answers on GOV.UK when there are lots of variables affecting something a user needs to know. As trying to explain all these variables in flat content would result in a long, confusing guide, weâ€™d use a smart answer (effectively a decision tree made up of questions and outcomes) instead. This allows the user to get straight to the content they need, while keeping everything that isn't relevant to them hidden away.  


    There are 2 different types of smart answers:  

    - [Github smart answer](./github-smart-answer)

    - [Simple smart answer](./simple-smart-answer)"
