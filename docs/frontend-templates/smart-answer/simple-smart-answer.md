howItWorks:
  " A simple smart answer presents the end-user a series of questions that channels them to a certain outcome based on their responses.
  

  Simple smart answers are built and edited in Mainstream Publisher. 


  We use this format if the tool doesn’t need any complicated variables or calculations.


  You don’t need a developer to make changes to a simple smart answer. They’re built and edited in Mainstream Publisher, so they follow the same workflow as any other piece of mainstream content."
