howItWorks:
  "Use this format for content that is regularly updated, for example if the process to complete a task changes.

  A detailed guide should:

  - answer a specific, task-oriented user need

  - be factual guidance the government has a duty to provide, not advice

  

  ### Audience

  This content is aimed at practitioners, for example teachers or accountants.


  Content containing background information about why a user needs to complete a task or the history behind it should be in a policy paper.


  Consider if the content should be in mainstream guidance instead."
