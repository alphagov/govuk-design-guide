howItWorks:
  "Any service starting on GOV.UK should have a feedback page, it doesnâ€™t need to have a start page.


  After an end-user completes a transaction on an online service they are directed to the completed transaction frontend template where they relay their experience using a service. The results are in Feedex. Satisfaction scores used to be on the performance platform, where you could compare scores across different services.


  Also, there is an option for a promotional banner to appear within the interface. Examples include but not limited to:

  - Organ donation

  - Reminder to bring id in order to vote

  - MOT reminders

  - Electric vehicles


  The domain for every completed transaction must have a `/done` prefix."
