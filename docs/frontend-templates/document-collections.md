layout: frontend-template-documentation
sectionKey: Frontend templates

# Step 1: Duplicate and rename this file to the proposed frontend template you want to include in the Publishing Design Guide website.
# When duplicating and renaming this file use lowercase and replace any spaces with a dash (ie. -)

# Step 2: Set "eleventyExcludeFromCollections" to "false". This will ensure that the code snippet is commented out and a page will be display withinin the Publishing Design Guide.
eleventyExcludeFromCollections: false

# Step 3: Establish the relationship of this frontend template.
# The relationship between frontend templates will be demonstrated visually via levels on the left-hand navigation menu. For instance, "GitHub smart answers" is only revealed when the end-user selects "Smart answer" since "GitHub smart answers" a child template to the "Smart answer" frontend template.
eleventyNavigation:
  # If this frontend template is not associated with or a child to another frontend template, set the field below ("parent") to "Frontend templates"
  parent: Frontend templates

# Step 4: Input data points according to fields below to the best of your ability. Any fields without any data points will not be displayed on the website.

# Name of the frontend tempalte
# This is the name of the frontend template (ex. Homepage). It is required to display the title on the page, in the meta data, and in the left-hand navigation menu of the frontend templates page.
title: Document collections

# Description of the frontend template
# This briefly describes what the frontend template is. It is required to display the description on the page, and in the <head> meta description.
description: Document collections group related documents on a single page that are aimed at a specific audience or reflect a specific theme or topic.

# Embedding the figma file of the frontend template
# This will display a Figma embed on the page.
# To add a Figma embed, copy only the URL within the embed snippet.
figmaLink: #Delete this comment before entering the Figma embed URL of the Figma representaiton of this frontend template.

# How the frontend template works
# Briefly descibe how this frontend template works. For instance, listing out what end-user can do on a page that uses this frontend template, as well as it's relation to other pages and its associated frontend templates on GOV.UK.
# You MUST wrap this in single quotation marks (ie. ' '), since markdown can be used to enter this information. To create a heading, use three hashes (ie. ###).
howItWorks:
  'A document collection could be used to publish:

  - a set of forms

  - publications in the same series

  - a mix of document types related to the same task or event

  ### Contents list

  The contents list on a document collection page is created automatically from the groups of documents on the page. Each group has a H2 that appears in the contents list.


  H2s in the body section are also automatically added to the contents list <a class="govuk-link" href="https://github.com/alphagov/government-frontend/pull/3507" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">change made in Jan 2025 (opens in a new tab)</a>. Departments might do this when they need to link to external websites which they cannot add to a group. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/technical-guidance-for-regulated-industry-sectors-environmental-permitting" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">An example of a page with H2s in the body (opens in a new tab)</a>. 
  
  ### Contextual sidebar
  
  If a page is part of a document collection, the document collection that it’s part of will automatically appear in the sidebar under the related content section. 


  If a page is part of multiple collections, all the collections are displayed. Examples: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/how-to-register-a-trade-mark" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Register a trademark (opens in a new tab)</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/self-assessment-helpsheets-trusts-and-estates" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Self Assessment forms and helpsheets for trusts and estates (opens in a new tab)</a>.
  
  ### Rules on how multiple collections are ordered in the sidebar

  Collection pages appear in the sidebar under related content links on pages that are part of a document collection. If more than one collection page is listed, they are ordered by the respective item’s position within them. 
  

  Example: The content item <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-framework-for-key-stages-1-to-4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">National curriculum in England: framework for key stages 1 to 4 (opens in a new tab)</a> belongs to 3 document collections. It’s the first item in "National curriculum", so that document collection appears first in the list. It’s the 17th item in the "Schools: statutory guidance" document collection, making this the second link in the sidebar. It is also the 54th item in the "Local-authority-maintained schools: governance" collection, therefore showing this as the third link.

  ### Email sign up links on document collections

  Document collections have a "Get emails about this page" button which allows users to sign up for email updates when:

  - there’s a major change to any of the tagged content items listed on the document collection

  - there’s a major change to the document collection page itself

  - the document collection is unpublished and redirected


  There’s an exception on some HMRC document collections where users will get emails about the topic instead of the document collection. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MR5OaFG_DOCmWGL9o9MSGIPLMFe2mmSrV6Va-99cSzw/edit#heading=h.jbja48mpt1t7" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Find out why they were set up like this (opens in a new tab)</a>.'
