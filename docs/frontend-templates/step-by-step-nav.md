# This file is a template to document a new frontend template within the GOV.UK Publishing Design Guide website.
layout: frontend-template-documentation
sectionKey: Frontend templates

# Step 1: Duplicate and rename this file to the proposed frontend template you want to include in the Publishing Design Guide website.
# When duplicating and renaming this file use lowercase and replace any spaces with a dash (ie. -)

# Step 2: Set "eleventyExcludeFromCollections" to "false". This will ensure that the code snippet is commented out and a page will be display withinin the Publishing Design Guide.
eleventyExcludeFromCollections: false

# Step 3: Establish the relationship of this frontend template.
# The relationship between frontend templates will be demonstrated visually via levels on the left-hand navigation menu. For instance, "GitHub smart answers" is only revealed when the end-user selects "Smart answer" since "GitHub smart answers" a child template to the "Smart answer" frontend template.
eleventyNavigation:
  # If this frontend template is not associated with or a child to another frontend template, set the field below ("parent") to "Frontend templates"
  parent: Frontend templates

# Step 4: Input data points according to fields below to the best of your ability. Any fields without any data points will not be displayed on the website.

# Name of the frontend tempalte
# This is the name of the frontend template (ex. Homepage). It is required to display the title on the page, in the meta data, and in the left-hand navigation menu of the frontend templates page.
title: Step by step nav

# Description of the frontend template
# This briefly describes what the frontend template is. It is required to display the description on the page, and in the <head> meta description.
description: Step by step is primarily navigation and not a content format. It’s not designed to replace or compete with guidance.

# Embedding the figma file of the frontend template
# This will display a Figma embed on the page.
# To add a Figma embed, copy only the URL within the embed snippet.
figmaLink: #Delete this comment before entering the Figma embed URL of the Figma representaiton of this frontend template.

# How the frontend template works
# Briefly descibe how this frontend template works. For instance, listing out what end-user can do on a page that uses this frontend template, as well as it's relation to other pages and its associated frontend templates on GOV.UK.
# You MUST wrap this in single quotation marks (ie. ' '), since markdown can be used to enter this information. To create a heading, use three hashes (ie. ###).
howItWorks:
  'Use step by step navigation to represent end-to-end journeys that:

  - have specific start and end points

  - require the user to interact with several pieces of guidance or transactions on GOV.UK

  - require the user to complete tasks in a specific order

  
  Step by steps can span guidance and transactions that belong to more than one department.

  ### Guidelines for not having a step by step

  Do not use step by step navigation:

  - when a user only needs to read guidance and not take a particular action

  - when the guidance or services that make up the journey aren’t on GOV.UK

  - when the journey isn’t linear, for example if you just want to present users with a series of options or to bring together related tasks


  You should not use step by step inside a service. Use the task list pattern instead. If a department wants to use the step by step pattern inside a service in order to track a user’s progress through a service, they cannot use step by step. 

  
  ### Examples of when not to use step by step

  We wouldn’t create a step by step to help users decide what kind of visa to apply for because it’s not a linear journey, it’s just a collection of options. But we could create one about what to do to come to the UK to study, and one of the tasks might be about finding the right visa to apply for. 


  We wouldn’t create a step by step for teachers on how to manage their workload because because it’s made up of a collection of related tasks. It’s not a linear journey with a start and an end.'
