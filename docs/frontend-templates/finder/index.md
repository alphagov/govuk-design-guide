  '### What is a finder

  Depending on context, “finder” can mean:

  - The “finder pattern”
  
  - The “finder technology”, ie. a product used to generate finders using content-store and finder-frontend)
  
  - A specific finder including the content it exposes is sometimes called a “finder” by editors

  ### What does a finder do?

  Finders allow users to easily browse a comprehensive library of similarly formatted specialist documents relating to a particular topic.


  Finders help users find a specific document, or set of documents, within a topic.


  Finders also help users who need to know when a document is published or updated relating to a specific topic or subtopic.'
