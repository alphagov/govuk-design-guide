title: Content type
description: Content types provide a reusable stencil for organising content that has a common structure and purpose. 
details:
  'For example, GOV.UK has content types for things like speeches, news articles, guidance and consultations. These content types provide the content items with consistent classification and structure.

  
  Content types contain [attributes](/glossary/attribute) — these can be core content or metadata. 
  
  
  In GOV.UK’s tech stack, the content type is coded into the broader content schema.'
