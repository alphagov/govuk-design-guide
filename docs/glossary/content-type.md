title: Content type
details:
  'Content types are a way of organising content that has a common structure and purpose. For example, if you had a group of content items that are all types of speech, you’d create a "speech" content type so they share a consistent structure and classification.
  
  
  Information architects model the attributes that make up the content types (including core content or metadata) and the relationships between content types.
  
  
  In GOV.UK’s tech stack, the content type is coded into the broader content schema.'
