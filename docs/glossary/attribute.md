Attributes describe the properties of a content type. They are the building blocks, structuring content consistently to make it easier to understand, manage, display and reuse.

Attributes can be core content written by a person (for example, title, description, bio) or metadata with structured values defined by the system / chosen from a predefined list (for example, date published, topic or country).
