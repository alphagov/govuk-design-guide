Attributes describe the characteristics of a content type. For example, a news article has a title, summary, author, date, body, location and tags. 

Attributes create consistent structure to make it easier to understand, manage, display and reuse content.

Attributes can be:

+ core content written by a person – for example, title, description, biography 
+ metadata with structured values defined by the system or chosen from a predefined list – for example, date published, topic or country 

Attributes are captured at a conceptual level in the [content model](/glossary/content-model). 

Attributes become properties when the model is translated into a [content schema](/glossary/content-schema).
