description: A guide to the terminology used in the GOV.UK glossary.
details:
  'The entries in this glossary all contain a preferred term (the term to use) and a definition (what the term means). They can also contain:


  - synonyms — terms that mean the same as the preferred term and are okay to use in certain contexts

  - non-preferred terms — terms that should not be used, for example because they have an existing meaning or cause unnecessary confusion for users

  - related terms — terms that are closely related to the preferred term but are not the same
