Layout refers to the arrangement of visual and interactive elements in a user interface. It encompasses hierarchy, alignment, spacing, screen sizes, and consistency to improve usability and accessibility.

Common GOV.UK layouts include the single column, two-thirds, two-thirds and one-third or 50/50. The layouts adapt to different screen sizes using responsive design.
