title: Content model
description: The content model is the output of doing content modelling. Content modelling organises, classifies and describes content so it can be understood and used by humans and computers.  
details:
  'Content modelling divides content into smaller pieces to support content reuse, findability and consistency. 
  
  
  Giving content structure at a more granular level than the ‘page’ enables better search, knowledge organisation and AI outcomes.


  Content modelling defines:
  
  - the different [content types](/glossary/content-type) you have (or could have) in your domain
  
  - the [attributes](/glossary/attribute) that make up each content type
  
  - the relationships between the content types'
