description: This glossary (or controlled vocabulary) captures the preferred and non-preferred terms we use when working on the GOV.UK platform.
details:
  'It covers terminology in the:

  - backend information layer — for example, content type or attribute
  
  - frontend presentation layer — for example, template or component 


  The benefits of having a shared vocabulary are that it:

  - creates collective understanding and consistency
  
  - reduces ambiguity and miscommunication
  
  - improves collaboration across teams 
  
  - supports onboarding for new team members

  - keeps systems coherent as they grow'
