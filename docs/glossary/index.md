description: This glossary (or controlled vocabulary) captures the preferred and non-preferred terms we use when working on the GOV.UK platform.
details:
  "It covers terminology in the:

  - backend information layer – content models, content schemas and content types
  
  - frontend presentation layer – templates, layouts, components and containers


  The benefits of having a shared vocabulary are:

  - creates collective understanding and consistency
  
  - reduces ambiguity and miscommunication
  
  - improves collaboration across teams 
  
  - supports onboarding for new team members
  
  - keeps systems coherent as they grow"
