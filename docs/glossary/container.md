Containers are flexible sections within a broader template. They give publishers more choice over how they display their content and how they structure the user interface.

Containers can be populated with content and metadata attributes, UI components, media formats and reusable content blocks.

Containers are part of the flexible config driven publishing weâ€™re implementing in Whitehall.
