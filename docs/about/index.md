description: The GOV.UK Pattern Library is a place for sharing frontend templates, components and patterns on the GOV.UK website and publishing tools. 
---
By encouraging collaboration across disciplines, we can create a more consistent, efficient and user-friendly GOV.UK website. The Pattern Library ensures that teams within the GOV.UK programme are not recreating existing design solutions, and focus on delivering immediate value to end-users.

It will also help onboard new designers and familiarise them with GOV.UKâ€™s design approach.

## What is the GOV.UK Pattern Library not?
The GOV.UK Pattern Library does not replace the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/).

Frontend templates, components and patterns in the Pattern Library should not duplicate those in the GOV.UK Design System. Things that have relevance outside of the GOV.UK website should be contributed back to the Design System.
