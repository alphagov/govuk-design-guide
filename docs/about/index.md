description: The GOV.UK Design Guide is a place for sharing frontend templates, components and patterns on the GOV.UK website and publishing tools.
---
By encouraging collaboration across disciplines, we can create a more consistent, efficient and user-friendly GOV.UK website. The Design Guide ensures that teams who work on the publishing platform within the GOV.UK programme are not recreating existing design solutions, and focus on delivering immediate value to end-users.

It will also help onboard new designers and familiarise them with GOV.UKâ€™s design approach.

## What is the GOV.UK Design Guide not?
The GOV.UK Design Guide does not replace the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/).

Components, patterns and frontend templates in the Design Guide should not duplicate those in the GOV.UK Design System. Things that have relevance outside of the GOV.UK website should be contributed back to the GOV.UK Design System.
