## What is the GOV.UK Design Library?
The GOV.UK Design Library is  a step towards a more consistent, efficient and user-friendly GOV.UK.

The Design Library is intended to encourage collaboration across disciplines and break down any knowledge silos within the GOV.UK programme.

Lastly, the design library will help onboard designers, both newly hired and those who have worked in other departments, to familiarize themselves with the design approach.

## What is the GOV.UK Design Library not?
The GOV.UK Design Library does not replace the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/). The Design Library is an extension of the Design System, highlighting the frontend templates, components and patterns that are maintained by teams across the GOV.UK programme.

## How is the GOV.UK Design Library an extension of the GOV.UK Design System?
GOV.UK Designers are encouraged to continue to refer to the design system, as it the stylings, guidance and accessibility notices for individual components which are being used and implemented by departments across the UK government.

## What are the benefits for our end-users?
The design library ensures that teams within the GOV.UK programme are not recreating existing design solutions, but rather focus on delivering immediate value to end-users.

Overall, consistency in design and communication builds trust and credibility with our end-users.
