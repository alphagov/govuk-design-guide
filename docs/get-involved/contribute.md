---
## Who can contribute?
Anyone, from any team or disciplines is welcome to contribute in any way.

## When should I work on documentation?
If you or your team have created anything new, completed research or made any updates, it should be reflected here.

## What should I contribute to the Publishing Design System?
Right now we are focusing exclusively on components, patterns and frontend templates.

## How do I know what to include?
For each scale of design components, patterns, and frontend templates we have created relevant documentation template to help provide guidance on what to include in the documentation.

## How do I propose a change to existing documentation
If you notice anything that is out of date, inaccurate or incomplete, you can create a new pull request. Information on the process on how to contribute can be found on the design library's <a href="https://github.com/nnagewad/DesignLibrary" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GitHub repository (opens in a new tab)</a>.

## What if I don’t know how to use GitHub?
Reach out to us on our dedicated <a href="https://join.slack.com/share/enQtNzc0ODgwMDM4ODcyMC04YjhkN2U2OTdkMmVlMjdkNTI5ZmYxOGE4Y2QwNGI4ZmFjZWU4ZGQzNTEzNzk4MGQ2YjY2YzU5NDcxMDc3YmM5" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Slack channel (opens in a new tab)</a>.

Or you can create an <a href="https://github.com/nnagewad/DesignLibrary/issues" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">issue</a> within the Publishing Design System's GitHub repository.

## Are contributions checked before they are live?
Any contribution is made in the form of a `pull request` (`PR`) on GitHub. Every `PR` is checked and approved by two members within the GOV.UK design community before it goes live. 

## What if I don’t have all the information?
If you have only limited knowledge or evidence for what you are documenting, don’t let that stop you. Make a start, ask for help, prompt others with additional knowledge to support you, etc.
