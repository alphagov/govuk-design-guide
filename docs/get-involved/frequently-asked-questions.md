---
## Who can contribute?
Anyone, from any team or disciplines is welcome to contribute in any way.

## When should I work on documentation?
- If you or your team have created anything new, completed research or made any changes, updates or even retired something to streamline gov.uk, it should be reflected here. So create or update documentation at the end of your project (making documentation part of your definition of done).

- If you have some time to help us audit what already exists on gov.uk you can do this at any point. (Think about making this one of your objectives.)

## What should I document and contribute to the Design Library?
For now we are limiting this library to [components](/components), [patterns](/patterns), and [frontend templates](/frontend-templates) used on gov.uk. When deciding what to document:

- You might have something you have worked on that you are well placed to document. Alternatively, pick something from our <a href="https://trello.com/invite/b/66c32aba108fc7e90e7b4d27/ATTIf9cb80c70723c20e7297e873bd09db260C186DF6/govuk-design-library-governance" target="_blank">backlog (opens in a new tab)</a> of designs we have prioritised to be documented.

- Most existing pages would benefit from additional information, especially on past design decisions, data and evidence that tell us how something is performing for users, or issues that need fixing. So if you know anything worth adding or have the time to dig out older files, help us fill in gaps.

## How do I know what to include?
For each scale of design [components](/components), [patterns](/patterns), and [frontend templates](/frontend-templates) we have created a documentation template. These templates include detailed guidance to break things down.

## How do I propose a change to existing documentation
If you notice anything that is out of date, inaccurate or incomplete, you can create a new pull request. Information on the process on how to contribute can be found on the design library's <a href="https://github.com/nnagewad/DesignLibrary" target="_blank">GitHub repository (opens in a new tab)</a>.

## What if I make a mistake?
Any contribution or change you make is checked by someone else, and can always be undone or amended, so you cannot ‘get it wrong’. The stakes are low.

## Are contributions checked before they are live?
Any contribution is made in the form of a `pull request` (`PR`) on GitHub. Any `PR` is checked and approved by two members of the community before it goes live. 

## What if I don’t know how to use GitHub?
We’ve got you. Reach out to us on our dedicated <a href="https://join.slack.com/share/enQtNzc0ODgwMDM4ODcyMC04YjhkN2U2OTdkMmVlMjdkNTI5ZmYxOGE4Y2QwNGI4ZmFjZWU4ZGQzNTEzNzk4MGQ2YjY2YzU5NDcxMDc3YmM5" target="_blank">Slack channel (opens in a new tab)</a>.

## What if I don’t have all the information?
If you have only limited knowledge or evidence for what you are documenting, don’t let that stop you. Make a start, ask for help, prompt others with additional knowledge to support you, etc.
