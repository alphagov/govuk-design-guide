## Who can contribute to the Design Guide?
Anyone, from any team or disciplines is welcome to contribute in any way.

## When should I work on documentation?
If you or your team have created anything new, completed research or made any updates, it should be reflected here.

## How do I know what to include?
We have created documentation template to help provide guidance on what to include in the documentation.

<p class="govuk-body">Below are code previews of documentation template:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list">
  <li>
    <a class="govuk-link" href="https://github.com/nnagewad/DesignLibrary/blob/main/docs/components/*components-documentation-template.md?plain=1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Components documentation template (opens in a new tab)</a>

  </li>
</ul>

## Can I propose a change?
Anyone can suggest an improvement, report a bug or correct an error on our pages. Look for the ‘Help improve this page’ section at the bottom of each page.

Instructions on how to contribute can be found on the design library's <a class="govuk-link" href="https://github.com/nnagewad/DesignLibrary?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-contribute" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GitHub repository (opens in a new tab)</a>.

## What if I don't feel comfortable using GitHub?
For the time being you can create an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://github.com/nnagewad/DesignLibrary/issues" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new issue (opens in a new tab)</a> within the Design Guide's GitHub repository.

## Are contributions checked before they are live?
Any contribution is made in the form of a `pull request` (`PR`) on GitHub. Every `PR` is checked and approved by two members within the GOV.UK design community before it goes live. 

## What if I don’t have all the information?
If you have only limited knowledge or evidence for what you are documenting, don’t let that stop you. Make a start, ask for help, prompt others with additional knowledge to support you, etc.
