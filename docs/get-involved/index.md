## Be part of the conversation
To get involved in current conversations about the library <a class="govuk-link" href="https://join.slack.com/share/enQtNzc0ODgwMDM4ODcyMC04YjhkN2U2OTdkMmVlMjdkNTI5ZmYxOGE4Y2QwNGI4ZmFjZWU4ZGQzNTEzNzk4MGQ2YjY2YzU5NDcxMDc3YmM5" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">join our Slack channel (opens in a new tab)</a>. Here you can find out about what the community is up to and offer or ask for support.

## Discuss, review, and give feedback
Each entry is peer reviewed before it is published. Additionally, input from different disciplines enhances its quality and accuracy. Join us on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://github.com/nnagewad/DesignLibrary" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GitHub (opens in a new tab)</a> to help by reviewing and giving feedback on in-progress documentation.

## Propose or make a change 
If you notice anything that is out of date, inaccurate or incomplete, join us on GitHub to propose changes in the form of a pull request.

## Share information, examples and research
Each documentation aims to include information and insights from many disciplines. Add what you know or help us dig out documents and data on older designs and add them to the documentation on GitHub.

## Join a workshop
We regularly run cross-community workshops to document together.

We also run sessions to get people setup and trained in GitHub. If you would like to attend contact us via Slack.

## Contribute new documentation 
Take a bigger role as a contributor by adding a new component, pattern, or frontend template to the Publishing Design System.

You might have something you have worked on that you are well placed to document. Alternatively, pick something from our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://trello.com/invite/b/66c32aba108fc7e90e7b4d27/ATTIf9cb80c70723c20e7297e873bd09db260C186DF6/govuk-design-library-governance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">backlog (opens in a new tab)</a> of designs we have prioritised to be documented.
