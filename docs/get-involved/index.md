title: Get involved
description: This library is a community-owned, growing resource for gov.uk fronted. Documentation is a community effort. To document the myriad building blocks that make up gov.uk frontend and to include relevant knowledge from across disciplines, we need everyone’s help.

 There are different ways in which you can get involved and help us grow this library into a comprehensive repository, useful for different disciplines working on gov.uk. Below is an overview of these, to get you started.

## Ways to get involved
There are a few different ways in which you can support the growth of the GOV.UK design library.

### 1. Be part of the conversation
To get involved in current conversations about the library join our slack channel <a href="https://join.slack.com/share/enQtNzc0ODgwMDM4ODcyMC04YjhkN2U2OTdkMmVlMjdkNTI5ZmYxOGE4Y2QwNGI4ZmFjZWU4ZGQzNTEzNzk4MGQ2YjY2YzU5NDcxMDc3YmM5" target="_blank">#govuk-design-library (opens in a new tab)</a>. Here you can find out about what the community is up to and offer or ask for support.

### 2. Discuss, review, and give feedback
Each entry is peer reviewed before it is published. Additionally, input from different disciplines enhances its quality and accuracy. Join us on <a href="https://github.com/nnagewad/DesignLibrary" target="_blank">github (opens in a new tab)</a> to help by reviewing and giving feedback on in-progress documentation. (You will need a github account to do this.)

### 3. Propose or make a change 
If you notice anything that is out of date, inaccurate or incomplete, join us on <a href="https://github.com/nnagewad/DesignLibrary" target="_blank">github (opens in a new tab)</a> to propose changes in the form of a pull request. (You will need a github account to do this.)

### 4. Share information, examples and research
Each documentation aims to include information and insights from many disciplines. Add what you know or help us dig out documents and data on older designs and add them to the documentation on <a href="https://github.com/nnagewad/DesignLibrary" target="_blank">github (opens in a new tab)</a>. (You will need a github account to do this.)

### 5. Join a workshop
We regularly run cross-community workshops to document together.
We also run sessions to get people setup and trained in github. If you would like to attend one email Nikin (nikin.nagewadia@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk).

### 6. Contribute new documentation 
Take a bigger role as a contributor by adding a new component, pattern, or frontend template to the library. (You will need a github account to do this.)
You might have something you have worked on that you are well placed to document. Alternatively, pick something from our <a href="(https://trello.com/invite/b/66c32aba108fc7e90e7b4d27/ATTIf9cb80c70723c20e7297e873bd09db260C186DF6/govuk-design-library-governance)" target="_blank">backlog (opens in a new tab)</a> of designs we have prioritised to be documented.
Details on how to document you can also find on the <a href="(https://trello.com/invite/b/66c32aba108fc7e90e7b4d27/ATTIf9cb80c70723c20e7297e873bd09db260C186DF6/govuk-design-library-governance)" target="_blank">backlog (opens in a new tab)</a> or on <a href="https://github.com/nnagewad/DesignLibrary" target="_blank">github (opens in a new tab)</a>.

## How to document – FAQs
**Who can contribute?** 
Anyone, from any team or disciplines is welcome to contribute in any way.

**When should I work on documentation?** 
There are a few scenarios. 
1. If you or your team have created anything new, completed research or made any changes, updates or even retired something to streamline gov.uk, it should be reflected here. So create or update documentation at the end of your project (making documentation part of your definition of done).
2. If you have some time to help us audit what already exists on gov.uk you can do this at any point. (Think about making this one of your objectives.)

**What should I document?** 
For now we are limiting this library to [components](https://govukdesignlibrary.netlify.app/components/), [patterns](https://govukdesignlibrary.netlify.app/patterns/), and [frontend templates](https://govukdesignlibrary.netlify.app/frontend-templates/) used on gov.uk. When deciding what to document, there are two scenarios.
1. You might have something you have worked on that you are well placed to document. Alternatively, pick something from our <a href="(https://trello.com/invite/b/66c32aba108fc7e90e7b4d27/ATTIf9cb80c70723c20e7297e873bd09db260C186DF6/govuk-design-library-governance)" target="_blank">backlog (opens in a new tab)</a> of designs we have prioritised to be documented.
2. Most existing pages would benefit from additional information, especially on past design decisions, data and evidence that tell us how something is performing for users, or issues that need fixing. So if you know anything worth adding or have the time to dig out older files, help us fill in gaps.

**How do I know what to include?** 
For each scale of design [components](https://govukdesignlibrary.netlify.app/components/), [patterns](https://govukdesignlibrary.netlify.app/patterns/), and [frontend templates](https://govukdesignlibrary.netlify.app/frontend-templates/) we have created a documentation template. These templates include detailed guidance to break things down.

**What if I make a mistake?**
Any contribution or change you make is checked by someone else, and can always be undone or amended, so you cannot ‘get it wrong’. The stakes are low.

**Are contributions checked before they are published?** 
Any contribution is made in the form of a ‘pull request’ (PR) on github. Any PR is checked and approved by two members of the community before it is published in the library. 

**What if I don’t know how to use github?** 
We’ve got you. For an induction email Nikin (nikin.nagewadia@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk). Or read through our instructions on <a href="https://github.com/nnagewad/DesignLibrary" target="_blank">github (opens in a new tab)</a>.

**What if I don’t have all the information?** 
If you have only limited knowledge or evidence for what you are documenting, don’t let that stop you. Make a start, ask for help, prompt others with additional knowledge to support you, etc.
