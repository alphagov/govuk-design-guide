## Who can contribute?
Anyone, from any team or disciplines is welcome to contribute in any way.

## When should I work on documentation?
If you or your team have created anything new, completed research or made any updates, it should be reflected here.

## How do I know what to include?
We have created documentation template to help provide guidance on what to include in the documentation.

## Can I propose a change?
Anyone can suggest an improvement, report a bug or correct an error on our pages. Look for the ‘Help improve this page’ section at the end of each page to propose a change. Information on the process on how to contribute can be found on the design library's <a href="https://github.com/nnagewad/DesignLibrary" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GitHub repository (opens in a new tab)</a>.

## What if I don't feel comfortable using GitHub?
For the time being you can create an <a href="https://github.com/nnagewad/DesignLibrary/issues" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new issue (opens in a new tab)</a> within the Publishing Design System's GitHub repository.

## Are contributions checked before they are live?
Any contribution is made in the form of a `pull request` (`PR`) on GitHub. Every `PR` is checked and approved by two members within the GOV.UK design community before it goes live. 

## What if I don’t have all the information?
If you have only limited knowledge or evidence for what you are documenting, don’t let that stop you. Make a start, ask for help, prompt others with additional knowledge to support you, etc.
